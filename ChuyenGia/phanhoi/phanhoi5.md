PLAN APPROVED. EXECUTE PHASE 6.3 (CHARTING).
Team has successfully incorporated the Strategy Visualization requirement.
Final UI Polish Requests:
Layer Order: Ensure Candlesticks are rendered ON TOP of the Indicator lines (Z-Index priority).
Styling:
VWAP: Orange/Gold (linewidth: 2).
Bollinger Bands: Cyan/Grey (linewidth: 1, opacity: 0.5).
Data Handling: Double-check the Timestamp format (Milliseconds vs Seconds) conversion between FastAPI and Lightweight-charts to avoid rendering errors.
Proceed immediately. I want to see the 'Strategy in Action' on my screen.
