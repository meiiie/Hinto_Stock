PLAN APPROVED. PROCEED WITH FRONTEND SCAFFOLDING.
Technical Directives:
Dependency Alert: Ensure the development environment has Rust and C++ Build Tools installed before running npm create tauri-app.
Include Styling Stack: Please add TailwindCSS initialization to this phase immediately. Do not wait for the next phase. We want the CSS framework ready from Day 1.
Integration Check: When testing the /system/status endpoint in App.tsx, ensure you handle CORS errors properly.
Goal: By end of this task, I want to see a Windows App window opening and displaying 'System Status: OK' from the Python Backend.
